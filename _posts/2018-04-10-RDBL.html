  <h2 class="project__heading">The Project</h2>
  <p>
  As an avid book reader I spend quite a bit of money buying used books online. The books themselves are quite inexpensive,
  it is the combined shipping costs of the individual books that hurts the wallet. My idea was this: Curate a subscription box of
  used books and mail to the customer on a monthly or bi-monthly basis.
  </p>

  <h2 class="project__heading">The Problem</h2>

  <p>
  The potential problem I see with such a service is book selection. Every reader is different. How do we ensure that the customer
  receives a book title that they find interesting and worth the monthly cost?
  </p>

  <h2 class="project__heading">The Solution</h2>

  <p>
  To guarantee client satisfaction, the site will have a user profile where they list their preferred genres of books (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Mystery, Biographies).
  <br><br>
  We will also have categories to choose from such as 'New York Times Bestsellers' or 'Classics', so if the customer doesn't want to pick a specific
  genre, they can branch out and receive titles within genres outside their regular choosing, but still ensure a great read!
  </p>

  <h2 class="project__heading">Scenario Mapping</h2>

  <br>
  <p>
    When the user is first brought to the site they will be presented with the call to action to sign up for the service or to log in if they have an existing account.
  On the home page we will list the details of the service with a step by step diagram of the service from sign up to delivery.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Upon creating an account, the customer will be brought to a page asking them to enter information about their personal inerests.
  These responses will help curate what types of books are selected for their book package each month. These responses will range from their preferred genre of books
  to the length of books they typically read.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Once their preferences are entered. They will be prompted to choose a subscription plan. We will offer 2 plans consisting of 3 books per month
    or 6 books per month. From this screen they will be asked to enter billing and shipping information and any applicable coupon codes.
    Lastly, they will be asked to confirm all their order details (book preferences, shipping, and billing info) before final confirmation.
