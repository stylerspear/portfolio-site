<h2 class="project__heading">The Project</h2>
<p>
  This project spawned out of a real problem my coworkers experience on a day to day basis with the web app we
  use to clock in and out of work. The main issue with the application is that it allows someone who has already clocked
  in to work to clock in a second time later in the day when they were actually attempting to click the "clock out" button.
  Unfortunately there is no "undo" feature so the only way to correct the time sheet is to ask a manager to go in and manually
  adjust the time.

<p>
  I think this is a simple problem to fix and in doing so it would assist many frustrated users, as well as their managers
  who won't have to spend their time fixing a mistake caused by poor user design.
</p>

<h2 class="project__heading">The Problem</h2>
<p>
  As previously stated the problem is the ability for an end user to mistakenly clock in or out twice in a row, thereby putting an
  invalid time entry on their time sheet. The clock in and out buttons are right next to one another and look identical other than
  their verbiage. Below is a screenshot of the current user interface.

<h2 class="project__heading">The Solution</h2>
<p>
  My proposed solution is simple, but an effective one that will eliminate the possibility of clicking clock
  in or out twice in a row. In my design, once a user has clocked in, when they navigate back to the site when clocking out
  for the day, they will only have the clock out button available. Similarly, when they go to clock back in the next day
  only the "Clock In" option will be available.
