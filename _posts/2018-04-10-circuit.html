<h2 class="project__heading">The Project</h2>
<p>
  This was a project for a theoretical electric bicycle ride sharing company. I thought it would be an interesting
  challenge to design a mobile app from the ground up and this topic is also something I am interested in personally, as electric
  transportation is a growing trend today.
</p>

<h2 class="project__heading">The Problem</h2>
<p>
  Electric bikes are economically viable as well as environmentally friendly. However, the cost of an electric bike is substantially
  higher than that of its human-powered counterparts. A way to mitigate the cost of owning an electric bike would be to use a ride sharing app
  where you can find an electric bike in your area and rent it for however long you would like.
</p>
<p>
  I am visualizing this design challenge in 3 parts:
  <br>
  <br>
  1. Account set up
  <br>
  2. Finding a bike station
  <br>
  3. Activating the bike
</p>

<h2 class="project__heading">The Solution</h2>
<p>
  For the account set up, I plan to have users sign up with the standard email and password. They will also be required
  to enter payment info in order to submit payment for bike rentals
</p>
<p>
  I plan to use a GPS based location finder to get the user's current position and give them nearby
  bike stations. I will also have a map component that gives them directions to the station as well as estimated walking distance
  and bike availability.
</p>

<h2 class="project__heading">Scenario Mapping</h2>
<img class="project__image project__image--full" src="/img/circuit-scenario-map.png" alt="scenario-map">
<p>
Upon initial download of the app, the user will need to make an account or sign in with an existing account. The account creation
process will involve entering contact information as well as billing information as the bike rental will charge an amount to a card after
a ride is complete.
</p>
<p>
Once the account has been made, the user can start riding. From here on out, when they open the app they will be brought directly to the map
page which shows nearby bike charging stations. They will be able to use GPS to get walking diretions from their current location to a
specified station.
</p>
<p>
  After arriving to the bike station, the user can use the app to scan a barcode on the bike to unlock it and begin riding. The app will track the distance
  travelled and once the session has been ended, it will charge the amount to the card on file. Returning a bike is the same process as activating one, the
  rider will navigate to the nearest station and return the bike.

</div>

<h2 class="project__heading">Final Design</h2>
<p>
  In my final design I made some significant changes to the interface after the initial wireframe.
  I found that moving the bike activation button from the middle of the screen to the top right of the navigation
  left more space for the user to view the map. And instead of having the word "activate" to indicate the required action,
  I substituted an image of a QR code to indicate that this was the input the user would need to tap to begin bike activation
  as there will be a QR code on the handle of the bike itself. Also, to save clicks, when a user taps a nearby station from the home page
  the navigation automatically begins, rather than having the user to have to click again to start the coordinates.
